LibraryPy is a database application that holds Python libraries and their functions in one place. With a simple and easy to use gui that can be run without any languages installed. On the first column to the left holds tags that fit to each library, one library has multiple tags. The middle column holds all the libraries after you select a tag. The last column has most of the functions the selected library has in this order "function, explanation of function, example".

To add more libraries to the database use the attached script "add_to.py". Run this in python using "python add_to.py" after editing the script to add libraries. After running this command, you must delete old .exe and run this command "". This will create the .exe and put it in your directory (same directory with library_explorer.py, icon.ico, library_items.db) under a folder named "dist" as "library_explorer.exe". More libraries will be added through later versions.
